## 1. AI Tools Used
- **ChatGPT**: Primary coding assistant used for guidance, logic implementation, code generation and optimization. [Conversation Link](https://chatgpt.com/share/696b711d-fb78-8005-81b3-be74e59a4374)

## 2. Prompt Usage
Specific prompts and interactions used during development:

- **Project Kickoff**: *"The above Assignment1_QST file is what i have done and achieved in my 1st assignment. I have attached the assignment_2_paac file also. Guide me to complete assignment 2"*
- **Improving Fidelity**: *"I've got the mean fidelity around 0.7. Help me improving it"*
- **Optimization**: *"Now i got the mean fidelity of 0.9792, but it's taking longer time. Help me optimizing it."*
- **Scalability Analysis**: *"How do I track the runtime as qubits increase from 2 to 12? I need to plot this for Assignment 3."*

## 3. Verification
To ensure the integrity of the code generated by the AI, I performed the following verification steps:

1. **Theoretical Validation**: The Cholesky decomposition logic (`rho = L @ L.mH`) was manually reviewed to ensure it mathematically guarantees Positive Semi-Definiteness.
2. **Metric Cross-Check**: The `fidelity` function was cross-referenced with standard quantum texts (F = Tr(ρ σ) for pure σ) to ensure correctness.
3. **Empirical Testing**: The code was run against known pure states (|0⟩, |1⟩, etc.). The high fidelity results (>0.97) empirically confirm the logic is correct.
